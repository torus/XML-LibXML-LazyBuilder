NAME
    XML::LibXML::LazyBuilder - easy and lazy way to create XML documents for
    XML::LibXML

SYNOPSIS
      use XML::LibXML::LazyBuilder;

      {
          package XML::LibXML::LazyBuilder;
          $d = DOM (E A => {at1 => "val1", at2 => "val2"},
                    ((E B => {}, ((E "C"),
                                  (E D => {}, "Content of D"))),
                     (E E => {}, ((E F => {}, "Content of F"),
                                  (E "G")))));
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module significantly abridges the overhead of working with
    XML::LibXML by enabling developers to write concise, nested structures
    that evaluate into XML::LibXML objects.

FUNCTIONS
  E
        my $sub = E tagname => \%attr, @children;

        my $doc = DOM $sub;

    This function returns a "CODE" reference which itself evaluates to an
    XML::LibXML::Element object. The function returned from "E" expects an
    XML::LibXML::Document object as its only argument, which is conveniently
    provided by "DOM".

   Using "E" with an existing XML document
    "E" can also be used to compose the subtree of an existing XML element.
    Instead of supplying a name as the first argument of "E", supply an
    XML::LibXML::Element object. Note, however, that any attributes present
    in that object will be overwritten by "\%attr", and the supplied element
    *must* be bound to a document, or the function will croak. This is to
    ensure that the subtree is connected to the element's document and not
    some other document.

    As such, any XML::LibXML::Document object passed into the function
    returned by "E" will be ignored in favour of the document connected to
    the supplied element. This also means that "E($elem => \%attr,
    @children)->($ignored_dom);" can be called in void context, because it
    will just return $elem.

        # parse an existing XML document
        my $doc = XML::LibXML->load_xml(location => 'my.xml');

        # find an element of interest
        my ($existing) = $doc->findnodes('//some-element[1]');

        # prepare the subtree
        my $sub = E $existing => \%attr, @children;

        # this will overwrite the attributes of $existing and append
        # @children to it; normally the document is passed as an argument
        # but in this case it would be derived from $existing.

        $sub->();

        # we also don't care about the output of this function, since it
        # will have modified $doc, which we already have access to.

    Note as well that members of @children can be XML::LibXML::Node objects.

   Namespaces
    Qualified element names and namespace declaration attributes will behave
    largely as expected. This means that:

        E 'foo:bar' => { 'xmlns:foo' => 'urn:x-foo:' }; # ...

    ...will properly induct the generated element into the "foo" namespace.
    E attempts to infer the namespace mapping from the document, so child
    elements with qualified names will inherit the mapping from their
    ancestors.

        CAVEAT: When "E" is executed in the context of an *element name*
        rather than with an existing XML::LibXML::Element, the namespace
        mappings are scanned from the context of the document root, in
        document order. This means that the last namespace declaration that
        appears in the existing document (depth-first) will occupy the given
        prefix. When an existing element is passed into "E", the namespace
        search begins there and ascends to the root. If you have any
        concerns about collisions of namespace declarations, use that form
        instead.

  DOM
        my $doc = DOM \&docroot, $var, $enc;

        # With defaults, this is shorthand for:

        my $doc = E($name => \%attr,
                    @children)->(XML::LibXML::Document->new);

    Generates a "XML::LibXML::Document" object. The first argument is a
    "CODE" reference created by "E". $var represents the version in the XML
    declaration, and $enc is the character encoding, which default to 1.0
    and "utf-8", respectively.

EXPORT
    None by default.

    :all
        Exports "E" and "DOM".

EXAMPLES
    If you nest your code in braces and use a "package" declaration like so,
    you can avoid polluting the calling package's namespace:

      my $d;
      {
          package XML::LibXML::LazyBuilder;
          $d = DOM (E A => {at1 => "val1", at2 => "val2"},
                    ((E B => {}, ((E "C"),
                                  (E D => {}, "Content of D"))),
                     (E E => {}, ((E F => {}, "Content of F"),
                                  (E "G")))));
      }

    Then, "$d->toString" will generate XML like this:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <A at1="val1" at2="val2"><B><C/><D>Content of D</D></B><E><F>Content of F</F><G/></E></A>
